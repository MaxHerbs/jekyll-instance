## Motivation
This was originally supposed to be a cheap and cheerfull fix to a problem I have with commuting. I have a fairly significant commute right now, but my employer offers a flexi-time scheme which is a great way to avoid rush hour where possible. This however leads to my daily question and the motivation for this project; has the traffic cleared up yet?

I needed a simple desktop device that I could take an occasional glance at that would let me know how long it would take to get home, allowing me to work when suitable and head home when the traffic reached a reasonble level.


## Prototyping
Using an ESP32 - a highly capable microprocessor with significant amount of GPIO and onboard wifi - I build a prototype on a breadboard.
