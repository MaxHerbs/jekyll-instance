## Motivation
[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) is a static, ruby based, website builder, designed to convert markdown into properly styled html, with a significant community producing a range of open-source assets and templates. It is blog-aware and produces a set of static files - removing bloated databases, maintainance, and providing better security than an active back-end. The only challenges of Jekyll is it's infrastructure - the focus of this project.

Containers are an obvious solution to trade the remaining maintainance for a larger one time setup. By containerising Jekyll and bundling it up with a webserver, the little maintainance can be almost entirely removed! These containers can then be moved into a kubernetes cluster to host a site, and possible managed by ArgoCD in the future to remove all maintainance


## Containerising Jekyll
The approach involves two layers of containers. [The first layer](https://github.com/MaxHerbs/jekyll-base) - the base - is used to manage dependencies. It is based on a ruby image, and includes the base dependencies such as the apache2 webserver, and exposing the correct ports. The repository contains a CI to build and host this image when it's tagged and provides a stable - but flexible - base image to build an instance on.

The second layer is [the instance itself](https://github.com/MaxHerbs/jekyll-instance). This image is built from the base. It contains the actual site, and a build script to move -___ the  static files into the webserver's directory. Again, there is a CI to build and host this image when tagged, providing a stable source for a kubernetes cluster to pull the image from.

To make development even simpler, both images have a dev container in their repositories as well - used to test the base image, and develop, run, and view the site in the instance image.
